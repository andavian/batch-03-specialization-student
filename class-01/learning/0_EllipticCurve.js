/**
 * Read the file class-01/learning/EllipticCurve.md and implement the
 * algorithm in javascript
 *
 * Build an Elliptic Curve that does:
 * - Point Addition
 * - Scalar Multiplication
 *
 * To verify your Elliptic Curve use the following values:
 *
 * y^2 = x^3 - 3*x + 4 (mod 17)
 *
 * Point A = (1, 6)
 * Point B = (9, 14)
 *
 * Point Addition:
 * Point A + Point B = (8, 4)
 *
 * Scalar Multiplication:
 * Point A * 4 = (12, 8)
 *
 * You need to use this file to solve the exercise exercise/keyExchangeProtocol.js
